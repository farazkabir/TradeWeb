#Type this command "update-database"
If it shows you an error saying something about there is no migrations or 
like that then first run'add-migration xyz' command and then 'update-database'
#Then Run The Project by clicking IIS Express button.
The project should be running after that.
#If you get an error like this "Could not find a part of the path â€¦ bin\roslyn\csc.exe" - then run "Update-Package Microsoft.CodeDom.Providers.DotNetCompilerPlatform -r" command first and then update-database if you have not done yet.

Note: The database files are added in App_Data Folder. It contains some null values in some fields in some of the tables as the database tables were modified and those datas were inserted before that. So, if you see any broken image links that is because of that. But The new users and datas you will be adding now should be fine.
